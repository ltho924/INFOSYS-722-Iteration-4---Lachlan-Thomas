# INFOSYS-722-Iteration-4---Lachlan-Thomas
Cell 43 in the jupyter notebook file shows up with a keyboard interrrupt message within the GitHub repository, however, when run sequqneitally all cells do successfully execute. 
I suspect that this cell either timed out or was preemptively cancelled during my final execution of all cells.

Thank you.
